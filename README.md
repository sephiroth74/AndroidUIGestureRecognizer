<br />

AndroidGestureRecognizer is an Android implementation of the Apple's UIGestureRecognizer framework (
Reverse engineered).

### From Apple API reference:

> UIGestureRecognizer is an abstract base class for concrete gesture-recognizer classes. A
> gesture-recognizer object—or, simply, a gesture recognizer—decouples the logic for recognizing a
> gesture and acting on that recognition. When one of these objects recognizes a common gesture or, in
> some cases, a change in the gesture, it sends an action message to each designated target object.

# Available Recognizers

* [UITapGestureRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uitapgesturerecognizer)

> UIGestureRecognizer that looks for single or multiple taps. For the gesture to be recognized, the
> specified number of fingers must tap the view a specified number of times.

* [UIPinchGestureRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uipinchgesturerecognizer)

> Pinching is a continuous gesture. The gesture begins (began) when the two touches have moved
> enough to be considered a pinch gesture. The gesture changes (changed) when a finger moves (with
> both fingers remaining pressed). The gesture ends (ended) when both fingers lift from the view.

* [UIRotationGestureRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uirotationgesturerecognizer)

> Rotation is a continuous gesture. It begins when two touches have moved enough to be considered a
> rotation. The gesture changes when a finger moves while the two fingers are down. It ends when both
> fingers have lifted. At each stage in the gesture, the gesture recognizer sends its action message.

* [UISwipeGestureRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiswipegesturerecognizer)

> UISwipeGestureRecognizer recognizes a swipe when the specified number of touches (
> numberOfTouchesRequired) have moved mostly in an allowable direction (direction) far enough to be
> considered a swipe. Swipes can be slow or fast. A slow swipe requires high directional precision but
> a small distance; a fast swipe requires low directional precision but a large distance.

* [UIPanGestureRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uipangesturerecognizer)

> A panning gesture is continuous. It begins (began) when the minimum number of fingers allowed (
> minimumNumberOfTouches) has moved enough to be considered a pan. It changes (changed) when a finger
> moves while at least the minimum number of fingers are pressed down. It ends (ended) when all
> fingers are lifted.

* [UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiscreenedgepangesturerecognizer)

> A gesture recognizer that looks for panning (dragging) gestures that starts near the edge of the
> screen.<br />
> The maximum distance between the screen edge can be changed overriding the resource dimension of
*gestures\_screen\_edge\_limit*.

* [UILongPressGestureRecognizer](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uilongpressgesturerecognizer)

> Long-press gestures are continuous. The gesture begins (began) when the number of allowable
> fingers (numberOfTouchesRequired) have been pressed for the specified period (minimumPressDuration)
> and the touches do not move beyond the allowable range of movement (allowableMovement). The gesture
> recognizer transitions to the Change state whenever a finger moves, and it ends (ended) when any of
> the fingers are lifted.

# Discrete vs Continuous

> The gesture interpreted by a gesture recognizer can be either discrete or continuous. A discrete
> gesture, such as a double tap, occurs but once in a multi-touch sequence and results in a single
> action sent. However, when a gesture recognizer interprets a continuous gesture such as a rotation
> gesture, it sends an action message for each incremental change until the multi-touch sequence
> concludes. <small>(from https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uigesturerecognizer)</small>

There are 2 types of UI GestureRecognizers: **UIContinuousRecognizer** and *
*UIDiscreteGestureRecognizer**

#### UIDiscreteGestureRecognizer

Gesture Recognizers that implement this interface will only fire the `Ended` state change.
Internally they will switch between `Possible`, `Ended`, `Failed` or `Cancelled` state.

#### UIContinuousRecognizer

A continuous gesture which will dispatch `Began`, `Changed` and `Ended` state changed events (for
instance a pinch gesture, or a rotate gesture).

# Example

```java
    class MainActivity :AppCompatActivity(){

        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState:Bundle?){
        ...

        val delegate=UIGestureRecognizerDelegate();

        // single tap gesture
        val recognizer1=new UITapGestureRecognizer(this)
        recognizer1.tapsRequired=1
        recognizer1.touchesRequired=1
        recognizer1.tag="single-tap";
        recognizer1.actionListener=actionListener

        // double tap gesture
        val recognizer2=UITapGestureRecognizer(this)
        recognizer2.tag="double-tap"
        recognizer2.tapsRequired=2
        recognizer2.touchesRequired=1
        recognizer2.actionListener=actionListener

        // We want to recognize a single tap and a double tap separately. Normally, when the user
        // performs a double tap, the single tap would be triggered twice.
        // In this way, however, the single tap will wait until the double tap will fail. So a single tap
        // and a double tap will be triggered separately.
        recognizer1.requireFailureOf=recognizer2

        // add both gestures to the delegate
        delegate.addGestureRecognizer(recognizer)
        delegate.addGestureRecognizer(recognizer2)

        // forward the touch events to the delegate
        val rootView=findViewById(R.id.root)
        rootView.setGestureDelegate(delegate)

        // optional delegate methods
        delegate.shouldReceiveTouch={recognizer->true}
        delegate.shouldBegin={recognizer->true}
        delegate.shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWithGestureRecognizer={recognizer,other->true}
        }

// gesture recognizer actionlistener
private val actionListener={recognizer:UIGestureRecognizer->
        // gesture recognized
        }

```
